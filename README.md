# Predict-Diabetes
Its an ML Project used to predict diabetes

Diabetes is the most common problem in present world. Many people realize that they have diabetes very late so that the treatment might not be useful. Every one might not have the required facilities to check if they have diabetes or not. To help for such kind of people I developed this project. Its accuraacy is around 77%. and the rest 23% can be reduced in future.
